# Take Home Challenge: Fornova Challenge

This repository contains the necessary codes for Fornova Challenge.

## Installation & Start

The setup is fairly simple. Just install the libraries with `npm i` command and build the code from source with `npm run build` command. All the libraries are version locked so there shouldn't be any problem with installation.

After completing the build, you can run the script with `npm run start` and see the elevators going up and down

## Testing

To test this service, install the libraries with `npm i` command. After the installation is complete, use `npm test` command. This will fire up the `jest` and run positive/negative tests.
